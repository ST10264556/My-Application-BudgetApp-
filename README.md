# My-Application-BudgetApp-

Budget Tracker App (Kotlin + Firebase)
Purpose of the App:
This app helps users track their personal expenses and income by category. It includes visual analytics 
and gamification to motivate better budgeting habits. The app was developed in Kotlin using Android Studio 
and integrates with Firebase for authentication and data storage.

Key Features:
User authentication with Firebase
Add income and expense transactions
View categorized spending data in a bar chart
Set monthly minimum and maximum budget goals per category
Track how well you are meeting your goals visually
Earn badges for good financial habits (gamification)
Save user profile details and preferences
Navigation using BottomNavigationView

Design Considerations:
Firebase Firestore was used for its real-time sync and ease of use with structured data (transactions, 
profiles, goals, badges).
MVVM-like separation was loosely followed to keep logic readable.
UI built with LinearLayout, ScrollView, RecyclerView, and BarChart from MPAndroidChart.
Optimized for mobile usability and offline-first user experience.
Used EditText and Spinner for input, and BarChart for analytics.

Logging and Comments
Comments have been added to all major classes and functions to explain logic clearly.
Log.d() is used in key places to assist with debugging and show understanding of the code.
